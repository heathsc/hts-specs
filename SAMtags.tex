This document is a companion to the {\sl Sequence Alignment/Map Format
Specification} that defines the SAM and~BAM formats, and to the {\sl CRAM
Format Specification} that defines the CRAM format.\footnote{See
\href{http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf}{\tt SAMv1.pdf} and
\href{http://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/CRAMv3.pdf}{\tt CRAMv3.pdf}
at \url{https://github.com/samtools/hts-specs}.}
Alignment records in each of these formats may contain a number of optional
fields, each labelled with a {\it tag\/} identifying that field's data.
This document describes each of the predefined standard tags, and discusses
conventions around creating new tags.

\section{Standard tags}

Predefined standard tags are listed in the following table and described
in greater detail in later subsections.
Optional fields are usually displayed as {\tt TAG:TYPE:VALUE}; the {\it type\/}
may be one of
{\tt A} (character),
{\tt B} (general array),
{\tt f} (real number),
{\tt H} (hexadecimal array),
{\tt i} (integer),
or
{\tt Z} (string).

\footnotetext{The {\tt CT} tag is intended primarily for annotation
dummy reads, and consists of a \emph{strand}, \emph{type} and zero or
more \emph{key}=\emph{value} pairs, each separated with semicolons.
The \emph{strand} field has four values as in GFF3, and supplements FLAG
bit 0x10 to allow unstranded (`{\tt .}'), and stranded but unknown strand
(`{\tt ?}') annotation. For these and annotation on the forward strand
(\emph{strand} set to `{\tt +}'), do not set FLAG bit 0x10. For
annotation on the reverse strand, set the \emph{strand} to `{\tt -}'
and set FLAG bit 0x10. The \emph{type} and any \emph{keys} and their
optional \emph{values} are all percent encoded according to
RFC3986 to escape meta-characters `{\tt =}', `{\tt \%}', `{\tt ;}',
`{\tt |}' or non-printable characters not matched by the isprint()
macro (with the C locale). For example a percent sign becomes
`{\tt \%2C}'. The CT record matches:
``{\tt \emph{strand};\emph{type}(;\emph{key}(=\emph{value}))*}''.
%NOTE - This leaves open the possibility of allowing multiple such
%entries for a single CT tag to be combined with | as in the PT tag.
}%End of CT tag footnote
\stepcounter{footnote}
\footnotetext{The {\tt MD} field aims to achieve SNP/indel calling without
looking at the reference. For example, a string `{\tt 10A5\char94AC6}' means
from the leftmost reference base in the alignment, there are 10 matches
followed by an A on the reference which is different from the aligned read
base; the next 5 reference bases are matches followed by a 2bp deletion from
the reference; the deleted sequence is AC; the last 6~bases are matches.
The {\tt MD} field ought to match the {\sf CIGAR} string.}
\stepcounter{footnote}
\footnotetext{The {\tt PT} tag value has the format of a series of
tags separated by {\tt |}, each annotating a sub-region of the read.
Each tag consists of \emph{start}, \emph{end}, \emph{strand},
\emph{type} and zero or more \emph{key}=\emph{value} pairs, each
separated with semicolons. \emph{Start} and \emph{end} are 1-based
positions between one and the sum of the {\tt M/I/D/P/S/=/X}
{\sf CIGAR} operators, i.e. {\sf SEQ} length plus any pads.  Note
any editing of the CIGAR string may require updating the `{\tt PT}'
tag coordinates, or even invalidate them.
As in GFF3, \emph{strand} is one of `{\tt +}' for forward strand tags,
`{\tt -}' for reverse strand, `{\tt .}' for unstranded or `{\tt ?}'
for stranded but unknown strand.
The \emph{type} and any \emph{keys} and their optional \emph{values}
are all percent encoded as in the {\tt CT} tag.
Formally the entire PT record matches:
 ``{\tt \emph{start};\emph{end};\emph{strand};\emph{type}(;\emph{key}(=\emph{value}))*(\char92|\emph{start};\emph{end};\emph{strand};\emph{type}(;\emph{key}(=\emph{value}))*)*}''.

\section{Locally-defined tags}

You can freely add new tags, and if a new tag may be of general interest, you
can email {\tt samtools-devel@lists.sourceforge.net} to add the new tag
to the specification. Note that tags starting with `{\tt X}', `{\tt Y}'
and `{\tt Z}' or tags containing lowercase letters in either position
are reserved for local use and will not be formally defined in any future
version of this specification.
